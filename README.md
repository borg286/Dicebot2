# Dicebot2
Dicebot, the second one

This is a complete rewrite in progress of the original Dicebot. The intention is to overhaul the backend through extensive decoupling in the interest of extensibility and code readability by adhering closer to proper programming practices. (Read: Not putting the entire project in Main [AKA index.js])

If all goes well, then you won't even notice any changes save for some quality of life improvements.

The intention for this README is to implement some documentation for my sake and for the curious.
